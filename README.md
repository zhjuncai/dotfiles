Dotfiles
========
This repository is folked from https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles because
the author has the same idea just like I do. And he also wrote a exllent post
to introduce how to save and sync your own dotfiles.

I cut off files that current I don't need and leave all good stuff that
I thought suit for me.

1. Bashrc
2. vimrc
3. zshrc

Please ref to this great post http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/
